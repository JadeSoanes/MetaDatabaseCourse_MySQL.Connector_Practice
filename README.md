# MetaDatabaseCourse_MySQL.Connector_Practice
Practicing using the mysql.connector library to connect MySQL database to my python script

* The code first establishing the connection to the database.
* I then run SQL queries from the python script to create the database 'little lemon', which is a fictional resturaunt!
* I then add my tables and data (again in the mpython script.
* I then create two connection pools using connection pooling.
* I then create and test two stored proceduces - PeakHours (which shows the number of bookings per hour) and Guest Status (which assigned a status to a customer based on where their order is at eg. waiting for food, waiting to pay etc)
* Finally, I go through the exercises set to create more stored procedures and query my database.
* The code is in a Jupyter Notebook which has already been run - therefore the print statements should be showing without you needing to run anything!
